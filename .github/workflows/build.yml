name: Build followers feed

# This workflow runs on a five‑minute schedule and whenever the workflow is
# dispatched manually.  It uses Node.js 18 to execute the build script and
# commits the generated JSON feed if it has changed.  Secrets are passed via
# environment variables – they are never written to disk or logged.
